TekSpeks -- Organizing the world's technical specifications

I get annoyed when I can't find detailed information about a product so I
thought to create a wiki-style site which would allow easy access to the most
detailed technical specifications of any product that has ever existed.

Version: Beta 0.3
    * Database Backend nearly complete
    * Some pages aren't completely HTML consistent
    * Interaction not as intuitive as I would like
    
TODO:
    + Javascript for more intuitive user interaction
    * Better design
    * Continue to develop Database

TekSpeks is written with Ruby On Rails and is FOSS. Anyone may copy, modify, port
to other languages, and distribute TekSpeks code as long as attribution is given
to the original author: Justin Mancinelli.
